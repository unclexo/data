  It's uncle and xo.

<p class="text-base font-normal">
  I am a software developer with expertise in JavaScript, specializing in React.js 
  and its ecosystem. I am passionate about building secure, high-performance, and maintainable 
  web applications, leveraging REST APIs to deliver exceptional user experiences.

<p>
  I blog on
  <a href="https://medium.com/@unclexo" target="_blank">Medium</a> about
  software patterns and principles and something that really matters to writing
  maintainable code. I try to answer the questions on
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/7935051/unclexo" target="_blank"
    >StackOverflow</a

  that help software developers make a strong base in programming and software
  development.

  advocate Clean Code, SOLID Principles, Software Design Patterns & Principles,
  and the most important one, TDD.
