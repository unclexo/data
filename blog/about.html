  Hello
  <br>
  I'm Abu Jobaer
</h1>

<p>In most places on the internet, you'll find me as <strong>unclexo</strong>. It is uncle xo.</p>

<p class="text-base font-normal">
  I am a software developer and architect, PHP and JavaScript expert. I <strong>love to build</strong> web applications and APIs
  using tools. I am a Lead Software Engineer at <a href="https://xeroneit.com" target="_blank">XeroneIT</a>.
  I am also:

  <li>He/Him</li>
  <li>A husband</li>
  <li>A TV series and movie freak</li>
  <li>A good teacher (some people say so)</li>
</ul>

<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/unclexo" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and
  <a href="https://bd.linkedin.com/in/unclexo" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, I advocate Clean Code, SOLID
  Principles, Software Design Patterns & Principles, and the most important one, TDD.</p>

<p>I blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@unclexo" target="_blank">Medium</a> about software patterns
  and principles and something that really matters to write maintainable code. I try to answer those questions on
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/7935051/unclexo" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> that clearly need
  to be understood to make strong base.
